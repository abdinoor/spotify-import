#XSPFy

Migrates XSPF playlists to Spotify where they can grow old.

It's the ancessor of [Laspotipy](https://github.com/sepehr/laspotipy). Laspotipy does not work anymore as Last.fm's Playlist API does not work anymore. Exported XSPF playlists can be imported using this utility instead.

###Usage
`python xspfy.py XSPF_PATH SPOTIFY_USERNAME`
